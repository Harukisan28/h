                    <h3>Rikka Takanashi is a chūnibyō practitioner who enrolls in Icho Private High School, the same school as Yuuta Togashi. Unlike Yuuta, she still suffers from chūnibyō (eighth-grader syndrome). She believes she is a sorceress possessed by the "Tyrant's Eye" ("Eye of the Wicked Lord" in the English dub) that will reveal destinies. She wears a medical eyepatch over her right eye to seal her "Tyrant's Eye". Those who have seen her "Tyrant's Eye" are considered as completely signing a contract with her. She moved into the apartment above Yuuta's apartment to stay with her sister, Tōka Takanashi.</h3>

                    <p>Rikka was described as having black hair and black eyes in the novel. In the anime her hair was drawn as a dark purple-blue and is tied with a yellow ribbon, with cyan colored eyes and wears a yellow color contact lens on her right eye, over which she wears a medical eyepatch. She often wears a pair of roller shoes, which she uses in order to increase mobility and make tricks. Her idiot hair (ahoge) occasionally reacts to her mood, in a comedic matter, sometimes moving with sound effects.</p>

                    <h4>Student</h4>
                    <p>Throughout the series she is primarily seen to be wearing a school uniform that consists of black school blazer with a white dress shirt underneath it, tied with a red bowtie, wearing a red tartan skirt with small while frills embellished with a cross hanging on the left side of her skirt to which that does not follow up to school standards (once mentioned in the movie by her teacher), she then switches to a sleeveless version due to it being summer. She also has her fantasy weapon of choice: a frilly parasol which she wields as a sword remains concealed on her left leg. When outside of school or during her delusional operations she often dresses in a mostly-black gothic lolita dress.</p>

                    <h4>Student</h4>
                    <p>She is very dramatic and theatrical, claiming to possess the "Tyrant's Eye" which allows her to reveal destinies, even wearing an eye-patch to "seal its' powers". Her delusions tend to reflect her feelings in real life, such as how she professed that tomatoes burn away one’s mana so as to avoid eating. She likes to make references to other anime and fictional works related to her chuunibyou fantasies. Though she does her best to commit to her fantasies, there are a few moments when Rikka will break character. An example of one of these moments could be seen when she gets flustered or gets hit in the head by her boyfriend, Yuuta, or her sister, Tōka Takanashi. She is often stared at by her classmates in a rather rude fashion due to her weird outbursts, and doesn't try too hard to make friends. Although she acts like a cool and mysterious sorceress, Rikka is in fact extremely clumsy, usually receives poor grades, and failed miserably when she tried to join other clubs such as cheerleading.</p>
